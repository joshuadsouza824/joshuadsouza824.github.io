            <br>As far as I know Joshua (through virtual communication), he is kind, very curious, very assuring 
           <br> and he does not stop until he gets the right amount of certainty. 
           <br> He chats very openly, and I see a determined person in him 
            <br>because even though the current setup of learning is hard for everyone, 
            <br>he adjusts to it so that he can get the most out of it. 
            <br>And he is very respectful as well especially when opening the mic 
            <br>to speak and ask questions to professors.

            <br>Dear Josh, I can’t believe we’ve already been friends for almost a decade now! 
            <br>You are so much fun to hang out with and I’m so glad to have an awesome friend like you! 
            <br>I remember that I love coming to your house and just playing or just simply hangout. 
            <br>Our friendship has grown so much these past years. 
            <br>Even though we are in college now and have our own separate lives but,
            <br> I know that we will stay in touch. You have such a huge heart and have such a special bond 
            <br>with our circle of friends which is so nice to watch. Josh, thank you 
            <br>for being part of my high school life fun. You are not one to dwell on things that go wrong; 
            <br>you quickly bounce back and continue having fun. I have never seen you without a smile on your face, 
            <br>and the smallest moments give you the greatest joy. 
            <br>Nothing brightens your day like laughing in jokes or your own jokes, 
            <br>watching your funny videos, or just taking about a game we love. 
            <br>You are always making jokes, dancing, laughing, jumping, and enjoying life. 
            <br> It is truly inspirational for me to come from a day at school,
            <br>a setting which allows little time for carefree leisure, to your house.
            <br> You are so special, and your energy is contagious. 
            <br> I will remember all our fun times together: Friends at Home and school,
            <br> Friend circle, holiday events, and so many more. 
            <br> I remember the time we went to a trip, the time we lit our candles together, 
            <br> the time we first had a dance video together, and the time we played Tekken together. 
            <br> Thank you for the fun times, lessons, and memories. 
            <br>Having a friend like you has made a lasting impact on my life 
            <br> and you will do amazing things in the future. Please keep in touch always. 
            <br> My good friend.

            <br>Joshua was my schoolmate at Casa del Niño Montessori for quite some time before I graduated. 
            <br> Although I was not able to have a close friendship with him, 
            <br>I know that Joshua is kind, polite and very outgoing. 
            <br>During school activities, he was participative and cooperative. 
            <br> He was well liked by his teachers, friends, and schoolmates for being friendly.
            <br>
            <br><span>Joi Lymuel Tamayo</span> -   
            <br>Joshua is a very kind person that needs special help
            <br>because he doesn't understand the Filipino language that much.
            <br> He tries his best with what he got for the sake of himself and his family. 
            <br>
            <br><span>John Peterson Peredo</span> -   
            <br> Joshua seems like a nice person, he is really friendly and polite,
            <br> and I also thought that it's really cool to have a classmate from another country.
            <br>
            <br><span>Giulia Domalanta</span> -  
            <br>Joshua was a friend from high school way back 2017. 
            <br>He's a funny guy who loves to do unique stuff with cool ideas.
            <br> He loves cool stuff especially shoes that we liked talking about.
            <br>
            <br><span>Peter Joseph Antiporda</span> - 
            <br>I’ve known Joshua since he was a little kid. His mom is my colleague
            <br>and dear friend in our company. I see him often during birthday parties 
            <br>and special occasions by our mutual friends, But I know him more through 
            <br>the stories that her mom fondly shares about him and his sister. 
            <br>Joshua is a very loving son to his mom, a caring brother to his sister,
            <br>Kate, and a sweet grandson to his grandparents. Joshua has grown up to be a fine young man, 
            <br>always respectful of those older than him, mindful of other’s 
            <br> needs and always willing to extend a helping hand. He is very passionate 
            <br>in his studies and loves to learn new things. We get along with our 
            <br>common interest, basketball, sneakers and gundams.  
            <br>And even though I am older than him, I can say that I’ve learned a lot from him. 
            <br>It’s my prayer that he will continue to grow up to be a man who his mom 
            <br>and those around him will always be proud of.

            <br><span>Neil Perrie M. Abit</span> - 
            <br> My name is Neil Perrie M. Abit, and I met Joshua as a classmate 
            <br>when I was in 4th grade elementary, everybody regarded him 
            <br>as the weird kid because he wasn’t a full Filipino like us, 
            <br> he was probably the tallest kid in our batch, and even with 
            <br>those circumstances I still wanted to be friends with him, because I thought that
            <br>he wasn’t weird, I thought he was just misunderstood and he was cool. 
            <br>As I began to talk to him, I saw the soft side he had, I also saw that we had similar interests
            <br>like in card games, and Pokémon. Unfortunately, he may have transferred the following year,
            <br> so I didn’t get to know him further, but we we’re friends on Facebook since elementary 
            <br> so I could still see how he is, and we talked through chat a few times. 
            <br>
            <br><span>Jennifer Chua</span> - 
            <br>I’ve known Joshua for several years. He is the son of a dear friend and I’ve watched him grow up
            <br>from a sweet little boy into a friendly, polite young man as he is today. 
            <br>He loves to interact, is bubbly and likes to share a lot of stories.
            <br>As he is health-conscious he loves sports like basketball and swimming,
            <br> and he is great at what he does. I also admire him for his great talent in arts.  
            <br>His creativity is amazing. He is very smart and a responsible man and I’m confident 
            <br> he will do well in whatever career he chooses to pursue in the future
            <br>
            <br><span>Don Christopher Campos</span> - 
            <br>Joshua D´Souza is a dear person close to my heart. Not only is he the brother of my fiancé 
            <br>but is a good friend as well and I consider him a brother of my own. 
            <br>The first time I spent with Joshua was back in December 2011 when I met him and his family 
            <br>for a brief dinner in a restaurant in Dubai. Back then he was a very talkative and kind-hearted boy. 
            <br>Till to this day these personality traits still exist. He is fun to be around. 
            <br>We would talk for hours about common interests in Anime, TC shows, movies, games, 
            <br>and other cultural phenomenon on video chat. We also talk about deep topics on occasion, 
            <br>which I personally appreciate. My dream is to go on an adventure vacation with him
            <br> and really get to know Josh more.
