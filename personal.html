                My name is Joshua Malcolm D.S. D’souza, I am 22 years old, and I was born on 4 April 2000 
    <br>in the city of Ilagan, Isabela, Philippines to a Filipina mother and an Indian father.When I was six months old my parents 
    <br> took to me Dubai, UAE where both were working. I spent my nursery and kindergarten years in Dubai. On January 1, 2006, 
    <br>my father met a fatal motorbike accident. Sadly, he did not survive the accident and passed away.My father’s death 
    <br>took a toll on the whole family and our lives have never been the same since then. My mother, being a single mother and sole
    <br> breadwinner of the family has left with no other choice but to send us back to Philippines to make ends meet. I was moved 
    <br>to Philippines when I was six years old. I studied in Manila till I was in grade 4 at Lani Cassipe learning Centre and then 
    <br>continued my studies at MECAP in Ilagan, Isabela. I transferred to Case Del Nino from grade 7 until I completed the 12th year 
    <br>in high school. My mother works hard and saves money in order for me, my sister and my grandparents could come to Dubai and 
    <br>other places  for vacation during our school breaks. I am currently studying at Isabela State University taking up a Bachelor of 
    <br>Information and Technology. My first two years in college was conducted online due to the pandemic. My mother asked me to stay 
    <br>with her from December 2020 since our classes are being held online. At present, I am still in Dubai, UAE. I am a friendly person 
    <br>yet shy sometimes. I am very passionate about playing basketball and building Gundam. I keep myself fit and healthy through regular
    <br>exercise in the Gym, playing basketball on weekends and swimming three times in a week. I like watching anime and playing video games. 
    <br>I enjoy listening to music and I am crazy about slow rock music. I love watching basketball games and I  am an avid fan of 
    <br>Lebron James. Despite the availability of movies on TV and Netflix, I still prefer to watch movies at big screens, and I am 
    <br>so glad that the cinemas have been opened in Dubai since January 2021. I am diligent and I take a conscious effort to achieve 
    <br> a balanced healthy life. I manage my time properly to ensure I complete my assignments on time and spend enough time 
    <br>to do my hobbies and other interests. I stay connected with family and friends through social media like Facebook and Instagram. 
    <br>I am determined to work hard and achieve my goals in life. I will endeavor to graduate in college and get a good job so I can
    <br>support my mother who will eventually retire in few years’ times.My dream is to have a successful life and a happy family
    <br> someday. I am God fearing person and I have a high respect to people who are elder than me. My mother always tells me to 
    <br> stay focused and do my best in all the things I do so I can succeed in life. I will always remember her advice to me and
    <br> make sure to practice and apply them appropriately as I go on with my life. I firmly believe in the saying “The key to success
    <br>is to focus on goals not obstacles”.This will serve as my inspirational quote throughout my journey in this world.
